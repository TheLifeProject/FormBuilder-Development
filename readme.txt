Allows WordPress bloggers to easily create customised forms for use on pages or posts.

== Description ==
The Form Builder Plugin for WordPress allows you to build complex forms in
the WordPress administrative interface without needing to know PHP or HTML.
We've tried to make it simple enough for anyone to make them, yet customisable
enough to use for the most difficult job.

** Features: **

* Easily build complex forms without any HTML or coding.
* Pre-made contact forms for quick and easy setup.
* Put forms anywhere on your site.
* Put multiple forms on a single page.
* Split forms into multiple pages.
* Set up personalised autoresponses to send to the visitor.
* Optionally store all form data in the database.
* Built-in anti-spam capabilities.
* Optional CAPTCHA technology.
* Translatable.
* Multi-language forms support.
* Akismet and spammer IP checking
* Permissions control
* and LOTS more...

Created by the [TruthMedia Internet Group](http://truthmedia.com)

Programming and Design by [James Warkentin](http://www.warkensoft.com/about-me/)

== Installation ==
1.	Upload the /formbuilder/ folder and files to your WordPress plugins folder,
	located in your WordPress install under /wp-content/plugins/

2.	Browse in the WordPress admin interface to the plugin activation page and
	activate the FormBuilder plugin.

3.	The plugin should now be installed and activated.  The first time you visit
	management page, the appropriate tables will be created in the database
	if necessary.  In versions of WordPress greater than 2.7.0, the management
	page is located under the Tools menu on the left hand side.

4.	You may create new contact forms by using the controls found on the
	Tools > FormBuilder page.

5.	Once you have created one or more contact forms, you should see a dropdown
	list with your form names below the text editing area on the Write Post
	administrative page.

6.	If you need to modify the CSS in order to make forms display better on your
	site, you may add additional CSS information in the additional_styles.css
	file.  Styles in this file will cascade and over-ride the preset defaults.

7.	Have fun, enjoy using the FormBuilder plugin, and don't forget to come
	[visit us](http://truthmedia.com "TruthMedia.com"). For the
	latest	version, more extensive documentation or to stay updated see
	[our FormBuilder blog](http://truthmedia.com/wordpress/formbuilder/ "TruthMedia FormBuilder Blog").
